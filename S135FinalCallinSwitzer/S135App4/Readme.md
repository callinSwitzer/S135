This Shiny application demonstrates Shiny's ability to use reactive plotting.  It lets the user investigate linear relationships from animals.  When run from the R console, you can return the linear model by clicking `Stop and Return Linear Model`.  To make the figures, I used a species-level data set of life history, ecology, and geography of extant and recently extinct mammals.
