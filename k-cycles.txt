*** More Explanation of k-Cycles ***

Consider the following permutation on 8 symbols:

1 4 2 8 5 7 6 3

By writing the position numbers on top of each
symbol:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 4 2 8 5 7 6 3

we see that the "cycle decomposition" of the
permutation is:

(1) (2 4 8 3) (5) (6 7)

By this, I mean that 1 & 5 are fixed points
(same as one-cycles) and (6 7) is a two-cycle
(since 6 is mapped to 7 & 7 is mapped to 6).
I hope that it's now clear why (2 4 8 3) is a
four-cycle.

To count one-cycles of an arbitrary permutation
X is easy: form the difference vector X - 1:8
and enumerate the zeros!  

To count two-cycles of an arbitrary permutation
X is harder: we need to examine the "second-
generational mapping":

1 -> 1 -> 1
2 -> 4 -> 8
3 -> 2 -> 4
4 -> 8 -> 3
5 -> 5 -> 5
6 -> 7 -> 6
7 -> 6 -> 7
8 -> 3 -> 2

that is, we look at the "new" permutation

1 8 4 3 5 6 7 2

As before, take the difference with 1:8
and enumerate the zeros.  Be careful to
subtract out the one-cycles and also to
divide by two (to avoid double-counting!)

There is a very quick, beautiful way of
computing the "new" permutation using R:

> X=c(1,4,2,8,5,7,6,3)
> X[X]
[1] 1 8 4 3 5 6 7 2

Please study this carefully.  You will
understand the square-bracket notation
much better as a consequence.
